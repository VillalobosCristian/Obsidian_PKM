# Workflow for Managing the Physics Notes Vault

## **1. Folder and Note Organization**
The vault is structured into top-level folders to ensure clarity and focus:
- **Research**: Contains active projects, experimental results, and data analysis.
- **Concepts**: Fundamental topics like Fluid Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, and Bacterial Suspensions.
- **Equations and Models**: Key equations (e.g., [[Langevin Equation]], [[Stokes Equation]]) with derivations and explanations.
- **References**: External resources, including papers and book notes.
- **Visuals**: A repository for diagrams, plots, and other visuals.
- **Daily Notes**: Logs of tasks, insights, and ideas for each day.
- **Miscellaneous**: Notes that donâ€™t fit elsewhere.

## **2. Creating New Notes**
Use templates to standardize your notes and speed up the process. Below are examples of common note types:

### **Template for Concepts**
```markdown
---
tags: #concepts
aliases: 
date: {{date}}
---
# {{title}}

## **Definition**
Brief explanation of the concept.

## **Key Equations**
- Equation 1: $F = ma$
- Equation 2: $\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = 0$

## **Applications**
Describe real-world or theoretical uses of the concept.

## **References and Cross-Links**
- [[Stokes Equation]]
- [[Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics]]
