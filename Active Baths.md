**Active baths** are environments composed of active particles that consume energy to generate motion, thereby creating dynamic and fluctuating flow fields. Unlike thermal baths, active baths are inherently out of equilibrium due to the continuous energy input at the individual particle level.



- **Energy Consumption:** Active particles continuously consume energy to propel themselves.
- **Flow Fields:** The motion of active particles generates complex flow patterns in the surrounding medium.
- **Non-Equilibrium Dynamics:** Active baths maintain a persistent energy flux, leading to sustained fluctuations and emergent behaviors.



- **Einstein's Brownian Motion:** Traditionally, thermal baths were studied through Brownian motion, where passive particles diffuse due to thermal fluctuations.
- **Extension to Active Systems:** Active baths extend this concept by introducing self-propelled particles, resulting in enhanced and non-thermal diffusion behaviors.



- **Model Systems:** Bacterial suspensions serve as prototypical active baths for studying non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
- **Enhanced Diffusion:** Passive probe particles in active baths exhibit diffusion coefficients significantly larger than those predicted by thermal diffusion alone.
