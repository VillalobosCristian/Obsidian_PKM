# Active Matter

**Active matter** is a class of non-equilibrium systems where individual components consume energy to generate motion, leading to complex collective behaviors. The concept originated from the **[Vicsek model](./Vicsek%20Model.md)**, proposed by [Vicsek et al., 1995](Active%2520Matter.md##vicsek1995novel), which simulates self-propelled particles inspired by flocking birds and spin physics in magnetic materials.
