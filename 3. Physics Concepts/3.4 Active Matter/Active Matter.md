# Active Matter

**Active matter** is a class of non-equilibrium systems where individual components consume energy to generate motion, leading to complex collective behaviors. The concept originated from the **[[Vicsek model]]**, proposed by [Vicsek et al., 1995](#vicsek1995novel), which simulates self-propelled particles inspired by flocking birds and spin physics in magnetic materials.

## Key Points

- **Vicsek Model:**
  - **Particles as Points:** Simplified representation of particles.
  - **Fixed Speed:** Each particle moves at a constant velocity.
  - **Alignment with Neighbors:** Particles align their direction of motion with nearby particles, subject to noise.
- **Phase Transition:** Demonstrates a shift from ordered (aligned) to disordered (random) movement based on particle density and alignment noise.
- **Non-Equilibrium Systems:** Active matter systems are perpetually driven by energy consumption at the microscopic level, leading to emergent macroscopic patterns.
