# Active Matter

**Active matter** is a class of non-equilibrium systems where individual components consume energy to generate motion, leading to complex collective behaviors. The concept originated from the **[[Vicsek model]]**, proposed by [Vicsek et al., 1995](#vicsek1995novel), which simulates self-propelled particles inspired by flocking birds and spin physics in magnetic materials.
