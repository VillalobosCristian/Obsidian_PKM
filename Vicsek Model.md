The **Vicsek model** is a foundational framework in active matter research, introduced by [Vicsek et al., 1995](#vicsek1995novel). It models self-propelled particles to study collective behaviors such as flocking.

## Core Principles

1. **Particle Representation:** Particles are treated as points with no spatial extent.
2. **Constant Speed:** Each particle moves with a fixed speed, ensuring uniform motion.
3. **Directional Alignment:** Particles adjust their direction to align with the average direction of their neighbors, incorporating a noise factor to simulate randomness.


- **Phase Transition:** The model exhibits a transition from ordered to disordered states, dependent on parameters like particle density and alignment noise.
- **Collective Behavior:** Demonstrates how simple local interaction rules can lead to complex global phenomena, such as flocking in birds or schooling in fish.
