# Workflow for Using the Physics Notes Vault
Hereâ€™s how to efficiently use this vault for your physics notes:
1. **Folder Structure**: The vault is organized into broad categories like Bacterial Suspensions, Theoretical Models, Fluid Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics.
2. **Creating New Notes**:
   - Use the existing templates (e.g., Langevin Equation, Stokes Equation) to quickly generate new notes.
   - Link related notes using `[[ ]]`. For example, when discussing flow fields, link to the Stokes Equation note.
3. **Equations**: Use LaTeX for equations in your notes.
4. **Visualization and Diagrams**: Store diagrams in `Miscellaneous/Diagrams and Visuals` and reference them across your notes.
5. **Cross-Disciplinary Links**: Use backlinks to connect concepts across folders, like how active matter connects to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
6. **Daily Notes/Logs**: Use a note in Miscellaneous or Obsidian's Daily Notes feature to log insights.
7.
